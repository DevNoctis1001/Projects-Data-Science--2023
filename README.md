# Data Science Projects Jan-Feb 2023

"Data_Science_Projects_Jan-Feb_2023" is a repository I created to update my experience data science and machine learning.

From January to February, I did sprints to build skills and experience to keep up with the evolving state of the art in data science.

I solved some real-world tasks and pushed them to this repository.
