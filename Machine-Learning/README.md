Welcome! This is a collection of all our projects that involve Machine Learning.

# Marketing Analytics:

This project involves the analysis of a dataset that contains information about 2240 customers of a departmental store. The data is fictional and was made to practice Exploratory and Statistical Analysis in a marketing context. With the analysis that follows, we aim to extract insights about:

+ Customer profiles
+ Product preferences
+ Campaign successes/failures
+ Channel performance


# Retail Analytics:

The project deals with time series analysis and subsequent forecasting on retail data (two years worth of data (2010â€“12) on 45 anonymised retail stores). The goal is to derive insights and finally forecast department-wide sales for the year 2013.


# Loan Default Prediction

The project is about loan default prediction and the importance of understanding it for borrowers and financial institutions. The dataset analyzed contains around 50,000 datapoints and 114 features to work with. The tech stack used was Python and its libraries Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Nump and Sci-kit learn. The coding was done in Jupyter Enviroment


# Telemarketing Data Analysis

+ Problem: Banks need to analyze marketing campaign datasets to stay competitive and improve strategies.
+ Goal: Develop a machine learning model to predict the likelihood of a customer subscribing to a term deposit.
+ Data: Marketing campaign dataset from a Portuguese banking institution with various client, campaign, and socio-economic attribu

# Credit Card Data Analysis

+ Problem: Increasing number of customers leaving credit card services.
+ Goal: Develop a classification model to predict which customers are likely to leave and provide better services to retain them.
+ Data: Credit card customer dataset with information about 10127 transactions.
